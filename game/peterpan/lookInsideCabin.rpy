    "I quietly made my way through the cabin, into Captain Hook’s office. The room was tidy enough, aside from charts and maps and a picture of Peter Pan with a knife on his head, nothing seems out of place."
    "I searched the file cabinet but all are useless. As I was about to head back, I tripped on the rug and fell butt first to the ground."

    "That’s weird. The place I fell…it sounds hollow."
    "I lied to my stomach knocked on the floor, with my head closely listening."
    m "This area echoes. But here…nothing. I wonder."
    "I rolled the rug and investigated the floor thoroughly. Just as I thought, a hidden place. I opened the flooring and found a ladder."

    m "Well, no time to back down."
    "I made my way through the short ladder and found myself in front of a door with a lock. I kneel down to examine the lock and with some effort, managed to pick it open."

    "The door swung open, revealing a small, dimly lit room filled with various maps, documents, and peculiar objects. Unlike Hook’s office, it’s like a storm hit."

    "As I sifted through the papers. I found several maps of Neverland, along with strange notes and symbols. That’s weird."
    "I thought Neverland was an island, not an archipelago. And some of these places seemed familiar, but I can’t quite put my hand on it."
    "Oh well."
    "One document catches my eyes—upon reading, it described how Neverland is tied to dreams and the subconscious mind."

    m "Neverland exists as a figment of the dreamer’s imagination, a place created by the mind during sleep. To escape, one must realize the nature of the dream."
    m "Otherwise, they may remain in a state of sleep paralysis."
    m "What is this? Peter Pan, Captain Hook, Neverland. They’re not real? This is just a dream? Am I just in a sleep paralysis?"
    m "It doesn’t make any sense."
    un "It will make some sense. Once you wake up."

    "Before I could turn around, a sharp pain shot through my shoulder, I whirled around and saw a needle pierced in my flesh. My energy immediately left my body and I stumbled, collapsing to the ground."

    "I sat upright in my bed, surrounded by the suffocating darkness of the room. The dreams I had seemed to cling to my mind, refusing to let go. As if they were more than just figments of my imagination."
    "From the hallway, I could hear the strained voices of my parents, locked in a heated discussion. It was clear they were debating what I had told them."
    
    g "Mary, I am telling you, it was just a dream! From all those stories Wendy filled his head with—they’re not real!"
    d "But George, how do you explain why Wendy and John are missing?"
    d "Wendy mentioned Peter Pan earlier and now Michael kept talking about Neverland."
    d "Only Michael returned from Neverland; the others are still there!"
    g "Neverland isn’t real! How many times do I have to tell you?"
    g "Michael can’t even speak about anything except that place, that dream. He didn’t know if Wendy and John left or someone—anyways."
    g "I’m going to alert the Scotland Yard, get a search warrant for Wendy and John."
    d "Oh George dear, I am so worried about them."
    g "I know Mary. Me too. I swear we will find them, by any means necessary."
    "Outside, I heard Mother’s soft cries, muffled yet piercing in the stillness of the night. I heard Father comforting her, his voice also full of sadness like he was also comforting himself."
    "I glanced around the darkness of the room, the empty beds of my siblings a stark reminder their absence."
    "I was alone, surrounded by shadows and uncertainty."
