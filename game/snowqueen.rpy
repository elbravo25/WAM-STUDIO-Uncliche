    Freya wasn't born into nobility,

    position as an advisor to the King and 
    Queen of Arendelle.  She arrived at the
    castle relatively young, her past 
    shrouded in a veil of mystery.

    Freya possesses a natural talent for 
    diplomacy."

    court politics, mediate disagreements 
    between the royal family and foreign 
    dignitaries, and offer insightful counsel 
    on matters of state.  Her calm and collected
    personality allows her to remain composed
